# Apriori Algorithm and Park Chen Yu Algorithms (Data Mining)

The Apriori Algorithm Program takes as input the items (L1, L2, ...), their counts (frequency) and returns the most frequent itemsets that fulfill the minimum support and confidence criteria.

The PCY Algorithm on the other hand accomplishes the same in a more memoery efficient approach with the use of hash tables to store the counts of smaller subsets
